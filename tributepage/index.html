      <p id="about">ABOUT</p>
      <p> Shakuntala Devi (4 November 1929 – 21 April 2013) was an Indian mathematician, writer and mental calculator, popularly known as the "Human Computer". Devi strove to simplify numerical calculations for students.</p>
      <p id="math">MATHEMATICIAN</p>
      <p> Devi travelled to several countries around the world demonstrating her arithmetic talents. She was on a tour of Europe throughout 1950 and was in New York City in 1976. In 1988, she travelled to the US to have her abilities studied by Arthur Jensen, a professor of educational psychology at the University of California, Berkeley. Jensen tested her performance at several tasks, including the calculation of large numbers. Examples of the problems presented to Devi included calculating the cube root of 61,629,875 and the seventh root of 170,859,375. Jensen reported that Devi provided the solution to the above mentioned problems (395 and 15, respectively) before Jensen could copy them down in his notebook. Jensen published his findings in the academic journal Intelligence in 1990.</p>

      <p>In 1977, at Southern Methodist University, she gave the 23rd root of a 201-digit number in 50 seconds. Her answer, which was 546,372,891, was confirmed by calculations done at the US Bureau of Standards by the UNIVAC 1101 computer, for which a special program had to be written to perform such a large calculation, which took a longer time than for her to do the same.</p>

      <p>On 18 June 1980, she demonstrated the multiplication of two 13-digit numbers – 7,686,369,774,870 × 2,465,099,745,779. These numbers were picked at random by the Department of Computing at Imperial College London. She correctly answered 18,947,668,177,995,426,462,773,730 in 28 seconds. This event was recorded in the 1982 Guinness Book of World Records. Writer Steven Smith commented, "the result is so far superior to anything previously reported that it can only be described as unbelievable.In a 2009 interview, Devi recalled Indira Gandhi telling her "Shakuntala, remember I've got so many ambassadors all over the world but you're a very special ambassador because you're a roving ambassador, a mathematical ambassador, who can win friends for India and build up close relationship between country to country.</p>

      <p id="awards">GUINESS RECORD</p>
      <p>Guinness World Records on Thursday honoured Indian math genius Shakuntala Devi with the long overdue record title for ''fastest human computation'', four decades after she achieved the feat.
        The fastest human computation is 28 seconds and was achieved by Shakuntala Devi by successfully multiplying two randomly selected 13-digit numbers, at Imperial College London, UK, on June 18, 1980.

        The certification was received by Anupama Banerji, daughter of the late mathematician.</p>
